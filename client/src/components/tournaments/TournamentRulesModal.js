// Create the modal like you did Updte User Details
// This will replace New.js
// Use conditional logic to render the same modal, but will be slightly diff depending on
// whether "Host New Tournament" is selected, or "Change Ruleset" is selected

// The modal will be the same, but the backEnd stuff is what will be different.
// Begin by doing the backend route, and wire up redux.
// Host New Tournament will use POST tournaments/new, 
// while Change Ruleset will use POST/UPDATE tournaments/update
