### Future Tasks:
- JWT User Auth
X Tournaments Component (this before User auth, to practice State use/distribution)

### Current Task:
X Draw out how you want the front end to look.  Style, color-scheme, positioning and so forth
X Figure out what kind of links you want in Navbar.  Or at least, which main links you want (more can always be added once the nav itself is setup.  Like do you want it to have an icon? A SmashBros picture?  Etc.  Figure that out first, then move on)
X Continue following guide using reactstrap
X Do navbar
X Profile Section
	X CSS layout (container-row-col)
	X IMG (placeholder.com)
	X placeholders for user data

X Tournaments Main layout roughly done
X User directory route and layout (colors to be changed later)
X Tournament render with proper data

X Remove "My Tourneys" tab/route.  Integrate that with User Profile
- Profile Sidebar with Cards/Groups reactstrap
X Re-organize display of info inside tournament jumbotrons
- User Profile: Toggle buttons for displaying tourneys participating in (card/background varients)
X Figure out interesting way to have your tournaments in 3 categories
- Smash News (Carousel)
